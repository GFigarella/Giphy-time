# Giphy-time

* This will be a project to practice with APIs

* In this particular case, we will be getting an API key for giphy, and then use it to pull giffs from the website.

* The gifs will be static when shown at first, and then switch to 'animated-mode' when clicked

* The user will be able to input any keyword, and be able to search a gif related to that keyword.
